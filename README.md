# EncryptaAndroid


This small application allows you to encrypt ascii characters in a code. Is useful to send messages through any other application and to save some text.
The code that it generates change depends of the public key and to be able to encrypt the code you have to know the private key that was used to encrypt it.

Here we can change the private key. To be able to communicate with other person, obviously both have to use the same private key.
